# RecoSystem
*RecoSystem is a program that recommends movies to user depending of his genres tastes,
it works by a training function STILL in developing that modifies the values of user depending of what ratings
he has sumitted, and by movies genre values that are also beeing modify by other users values.
This means that the program modify all values by social interaction, because it isnt the same scary movie
values in a place where people like scary movies where people dont like scary movies. So it trains itself adjusting
social values.
You can see which people have the same tastes like you, or even which movies are similar.
Works with 3 CSV files that are introduce at the execution point by parameter. before exit program it saves new 
values to existing files and creating a new one with Epoc Errors to make a graphic with GNUplot, it automatically opens
once it has finish executing.
STILL working on training. 04/12/2020
